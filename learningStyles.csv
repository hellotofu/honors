This study is being conducted by Emma Geller, Ph.D., and Tiffany Widjaja from UC San Diego.



The purpose of this research is to explore different learning styles and study methods students often incorporate into classroom learning. If you agree to take part in this experiment, the activities of the study (e.g., reading an article about learning styles, studying the information presented in the article, and then answering questions about the material you read in a multiple-choice and free-response format) will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. You are free to skip any question that you choose, but we ask you to please answer them to the best of your abilities. The decision not to participate in this project will not adversely impact your standing with educators who provide you with instruction or training.



The risks of boredom and fatigue are minimized by using an article that university students are likely to find interesting and accessible, and by keeping pretests and posttests brief. The article may not be interesting to all participants, but participants may take a break if and when they feel it is necessary. The risks involved are no greater than those involved in daily activities. You may benefit from the study by gaining new knowledge and be compensated with Qualtrics credits upon completing this study. We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the University of California, San Diego may review study records. The UC San Diego Department of Psychology may also look at study records.



Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to take part. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and procedures used, and withdraw your data if you so choose.



If you have any questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Tiffany Widjaja at twidjaja@ucsd.edu.

A particularly glaring and costly result of this, we argue, is the wide acceptance of the idea that instruction should be tailored to a student’s so-called learning style. For example, students might be divided into visual learners and verbal learners (on the basis of a learning style test given to each student) and then provided with instruction that emphasizes pictures or words, respectively. The visual–verbal distinction is only one simple example of the many proposed taxonomies; a recent review described 71 different schemes. Given this advocacy by academics and the ensuing heartfelt praise of educators, tailoring instruction to students’ style is now a prevalent and profitable enterprise. However, as we and others have pointed out, a thoughtful review of the data provides no support for style-based instruction.

At first blush, style-based instruction seems to be supported by a large empirical literature. However, closer examination reveals that only a small portion of these studies use the only research design capable of supporting the idea that customized instruction produces better learning than using the same kind of instruction for everyone. To illustrate the appropriate design and the kind of result needed to show support for style-based instruction, we describe a hypothetical study of the visual–verbal taxonomy. Firstly, subjects are divided into visual learners and verbal learners on the basis of some sort of learning styles test (usually a questionnaire). Secondly, all subjects, regardless of their assessed style, must be randomly assigned to receive either instruction tailored to visual learners or instruction tailored to verbal learners. Notably, this means that half of the visual learners and half of the verbal learners will receive the ‘right’ kind of instruction, and the other half of each group will receive the ‘wrong’ kind of instruction. Finally, all subjects must be given the same test of learning. The results of such a study would support style based instruction if and only if the test scores revealed two findings: visual learners do better if instruction is visual rather than verbal, and verbal learners do better if instruction is verbal rather than visual. If these two findings are not observed, it means that both kinds of learners did better with the same kind of instruction, which is a negative finding.

Essentially, In order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.

Our search of the extensive literature on learning styles, which included written inquiries to prolific advocates of style-based instruction, revealed that the appropriate design was used in only about 20 studies, and the results of most of them are compellingly negative. These negative findings were obtained with a variety of learning materials, including some in science and medicine. By contrast, we are aware of only three appropriately designed studies that yielded a positive finding like that described in our hypothetical example, and these findings are not very convincing. In one case, no measures of the data were provided, and the authors reported that only one of three studies of the same intervention produced a statistically significant finding. In another study reporting a positive finding, only one of the two final tests revealed a benefit of customized instruction, the size of which is unknown because the research report did not include measures of variability or effect size. In short, there exist a smattering of positive findings with unknown effect sizes that are eclipsed by a much greater number of published failures to find evidence, and we suspect that additional null findings sit in researchers’ file drawers.

From a practical standpoint, even if the empirical evidence revealed a consistent benefit of style-based instruction, providing tailored instruction would not make sense unless its benefits were large. This is because style-based instruction is logistically demanding. Each student’s style must be assessed by tests that are often quite expensive, and multiple versions of each course must be created and offered. The practical question, then, is not whether style-based instruction benefits learning, but whether it provides more bang for the buck than other interventions (such as smaller classes or tutors).

If the empirical evidence is missing, why is style-based instruction so often assumed to have merit? It seems to us that the concept probably enjoys an illusory legitimacy owing to its apparent similarity to several undoubtedly true observations, albeit observations that do not provide any logical support for style-based instruction. One of these observations is that abilities vary across individuals in fairly systematic ways. For this reason, it does indeed make sense to speak of students who, in comparison with their peers, have poor visual–spatial ability and strong verbal ability, but this does not imply that such students will learn anatomy better if their textbook has few diagrams. A second observation that is often imagined to support the idea of style-based instruction concerns the indisputable fact that some academic subjects are best taught visually, others verbally, and still others by a combination of the two. As a point of logic, however, this hardly shows that the optimal instruction of any one topic should differ among students.

In summary, there presently is no empirical justification for tailoring instruction to students’ supposedly different learning styles. Educators should instead focus on developing the most effective and coherent ways to present particular bodies of content, which often involve combining different forms of instruction, such as diagrams and words, in mutually reinforcing ways. Given the costs of assessing students’ supposed learning styles and offering differentiated instruction, this should come as good news to educators at all levels, from kindergarten through medical school.",11.877,21.548,600.116,5,,,,,0,0,180.009,0,Students learn differently based on different styles. ,Yes that students have individual learning styles but not that they are particularly more effective if the teaching style was catering to it.,1,1,1,1,1,2,I would feel like I would need to discuss the matter further with the person.

If the empirical evidence is missing, why is style-based instruction so often assumed to have merit? It seems to us that the concept probably enjoys an illusory legitimacy owing to its apparent similarity to several undoubtedly true observations, albeit observations that do not provide any logical support for style-based instruction. One of these observations is that abilities vary across individuals in fairly systematic ways. For this reason, it does indeed make sense to speak of students who, in comparison with their peers, have poor visual–spatial ability and strong verbal ability, but this does not imply that such students will learn anatomy better if their textbook has few diagrams. A second observation that is often imagined to support the idea of style-based instruction concerns the indisputable fact that some academic subjects are best taught visually, others verbally, and still others by a combination of the two.
